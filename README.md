# Squidgame


"I created a simple game with a squid game theme, inspired by its trend. Initially, I developed it in Python, but as a beginner, I found it a bit challenging. So, I switched to HTML, which made the process easier for me. The game has a nostalgic element because it reminds me of similar games I used to play during my childhood computer lessons. While I originally intended to design my own sprites, I had to drop that idea due to limited time caused by exams. Instead, I used images from Google. I hope you enjoy playing this simple yet fun game! To get the best experience, I recommend running it in Chrome. If it doesn't load, try clearing the cache and reloading the page."  ---Shiv.Singh
